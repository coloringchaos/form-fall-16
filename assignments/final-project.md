# Objective
Utilize the skills you have learned in this class to produce a physical object using digital fabrication tools and techniques. You may make anything you want for this project, but the scope of the project should be substantial. 

You may use any digital fabrication technique we have discussed in class (laser cutting, 3d printing, vinyl cutting...), and I highly encourage you to consider utilizing a variety of materials and/or combination of fabrication techniques to create a unique, creative form.

You may iterate on a previous project or assignment, or you can start from scratch with a fresh idea. Be creative! You may choose to work in groups on this assignment. 

# Requirements
All four of the following components are required for a complete submission. 

1. **3D Model:** Create a 3D model in Rhino.

2. **Physical Object:** You may utilize any digital fabrication method we have covered to produce your physical object. Your object should be polished and finished. 

3. **Artist / Design Statement:** A written document (200 words) explaining your concept. This document as an opportunity to discuss your intention and process in creating this project.

4. **Blog Post:** Create a blog post that includes your artist/design statement and a description of your techincal process in building this project. Your post must also include at least 4 process photos - screenshots of your model and photos of the laser/assembly process. If you work in a group, each individual must submit their own blog post, although you may use the same photos and description.


# Presentation
Be prepared to present your project in front of the class. You should accompany your presentation with slides showing your inspiration and process in creating this assignment.  **You must show your physical object during your presentation.**
