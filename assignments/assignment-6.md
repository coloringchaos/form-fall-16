# Assignment 6: 3D Mini

3D print something small on the BTU Lulzbot printers. You may choose to print something from a previous assignment, or design something new. 

The objective of this assignment is to get you familiar with preparing files and working with the 3D printers.

Your final print should fit within a 3" cube - for this assignment, small is great!

**Create a blog post that includes:**

+ A brief description of your experience with this process
+ At least 3 photos of the laser cutting process
+ One *quality* final image of what you printed

Turn in a link to your blog documentation on Edmodo, also submit your Rhino .3dm file.

**Assignment 6 is due before class on October 5th**
