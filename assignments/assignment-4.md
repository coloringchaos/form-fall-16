# Assignment 4: Laser Cutting

Laser cut a 2-D design that you have created in Illustrator/Rhino. I suggest producing whatever you designed in [Assignment 3](/form-fall-16/assignment-3) - if you would like to laser cut something different, check in with me.

The objective of this assignment is to get you familiar with preparing files for the laser and the overall workflow of laser cutting.

Choose a material that is appropriate for your design concept - if you went with an old-timey aesthetic, wood is probably most appropriate. If you choose a modern, minimalist design, then acrylic might be best. **You need to supply your own material for this assignment.** 

**Create a blog post that includes:**

+ A brief description of your experience with this process
+ At least 3 photos of the laser cutting process
+ One *quality* final image of what you produced


Turn your work in on Edmodo - submit your .3dm Rhino file and also a link to your blog documentation.

**Assignment 4 is due before class on October 3rd**
