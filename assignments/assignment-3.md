# Assignment 3: Typography

Using Adobe Illustrator and Rhino, create a **2-D** typographic design. 

Carefully design both the negative and positive space, considering how the design will appear once it's fabricated. In [assignment 4](/form-fall-16/assignment-4) you will have the opportunity to produce this design.

Begin with a concept - where, in the real world, would this typography appear? What are the aesthetic qualities or design characteristics of this thing - i.e. is it delicate, powerful, playful, old-timey, etc..? Utilize a font and layout that supports this concept. 

Be sure to design this assignment at a scale that can be produced on the laser cutter in the BTU lab (the laser bed is 18" x 32"). 

**Create a blog post that includes:**

+ A brief description of what you made and the concept that inspired your design
+ Screenshots of your process - at least 4

Turn your work in on Edmodo - submit your .3dm Rhino file and also a link to your blog documentation.

**Assignment 4 is due before class on September 21st**
