# Project 2 Inspiration

With your group, find at least 5 visual references for project 3. Also as a group, decide on a list of 3-5 goals or objectives for your project. 

Alternatively (or additionally), you may submit hand drawn sketches of what you intend to build. 

Post your inspiration images to your blog and include a brief written description (150-200 words) about the goals you outlined with your group for project 3.

**Project 3 Inspiration is due before class on Monday, October 24th**
