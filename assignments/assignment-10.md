# Assignment 10: Final Project Prototype

Create a first iteration or rough prototype of your final project. You should have something physical to show in class, but it doesn't need to be the full project. Joint or material tests are sufficient for this prototype. 

**Create a blog post that includes:**

+ Inspiration images
+ A short description of your process thusfar
+ Photos / screenshots of what you've made so far

Turn in a link to your blog post on Edmodo.

**Assignment 10 is due before class on Wednesday, November 30th**
