# Assignment 9: Sculpting Data

Design a 3d form based on data. You can get creative about what *data* means - a few ideas: 

+ import a 2D graph and turn it into 3d
+ do something interesting with topographies
+ find a 3d model of a real thing and manipulate it
+ explore using photogrammetry / 3d scanning

**Create a blog post that includes:**

+ A short description of your data source and inspiration for this project
+ 3+ screenshots of your progress in building this assignment
+ 2 final screenshots of your model

Turn in a link to your blog documentation on Edmodo, also submit your Rhino .3dm file.

**Assignment 9 is due before class on Wednesday, November 9th**
