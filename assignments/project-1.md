# Objective
The aim of this project is to demonstrate the Rhino skills you have learned so far and apply them to create a 3D model. The development of this model should be conceptually driven and your model should clearly showcase the idea that you are trying to portray. You are free to create any object you like as long as the basic design criteria are met. You will be graded equally on the technical and conceptual approach you take for this assignment. 

# Requirements
All four of the following components are required for a complete submission. 

1. **Model:** Create a complex 3D model in Rhino. Your model must include at least 5 unique solid geometries, but the final model should be one cohesive model (unless your concept dictates otherwise). Your model should be built primarily with curves, and you should utilize the commands we covered in class to create compelex surfaces from those curves. If you chose to use any predefined solids in Rhino i.e. sphere, box, cylinder, cone etc., you need to apply transformations (unless your concept dictates otherwise) commands to them i.e. Sheer, Fillet, Twist etc. You need to develop this model based on the concept you pick. Save your model as a .3dm file.

2. **Artist / Design Statement:** A written document (200 words) explaining your concept is also required with this submission. Start off by coming up with a name and a tagline for your object. This will help you explain your concept in one line. Use this document as a opportunity to talk about why you have chosen this particular idea along with why and how does the model you have created complements this idea. Save the document as a PDF.

3. **Presentation Sheet:** Create a poster/flyer for the model that you have created in Rhino by taking screen shots from different angles (a minimum of 4 screenshots are required). These screenshots should highlight the details of the model you have created. The sheet should also contain text highlighting your concept. Use what you have written in your artist/design statement. Use ‘buzz’ words to enhance the presentation of the sheet. Pay special attention to the layout, design and colors for the sheet. Treat this component like an advertisement that would go in a magazine or a gallery showcase pamphlet. Ensure that your name is also on the sheet. Save the sheet as a PDF.

3. **Blog Post:** Create a blog post that includes your artist statement and a description of your techincal process in building this project. You should also post all of the photos that appear on your presentation sheet as well as a pdf of the presentation sheet. 

**You must work alone on this project.**


# Grading Rubric
50% of your grade will be on your technical approach and 50% of the grade will be based on the conceptual content of your submission.
