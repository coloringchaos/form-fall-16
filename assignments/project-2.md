# Objective
The aim of this lab is to utilize your 3D modeling skills and apply them to creating a physical object using the laser cutter. You are free to create any object you like as long as the basic design criteria are met. You will be graded equally on your techincal and conceptual approach. Remember that the parts you cut will be flat i.e. 2D. The challenge here is to create a 3D object using 2D parts.

# Requirements
All four of the following components are required for a complete submission. 

1. **Model:** Create a 3D model in Rhino. Show both the 2D parts and how they join together to create your object. Save your model as a .3dm file.

2. **Artist / Design Statement:** A written document (200 words) explaining your concept. Start by coming up with a name and a tagline for your object which will help you to succinctly explain your concept. Use this document as a opportunity to talk about why you have chosen this particular idea along with why and how does the model you have created complements this idea. Save the document as a PDF.

3. **Physical Object:** Laser cut the models created in Rhino and assemble it **without adhesive**. Bring this model to class on critique day and be prepared to present your work in front of the class. 

4. **Blog Post:** Create a blog post that includes your artist/design statement and a description of your techincal process in building this project. Your post must also include at least 4 process photos - screenshots of your model and photos of the laser/assembly process. 

**You may choose to work in groups of 2 on this project**


# Presentation
Each person (or group) is required to prepare a 10 minute presentation of their work. You should prepare a simple slideshow that showcases your process and approach in building this project. Practice your presentation.

# Grading Rubric
You will be evaluated on both the techincal and conceptual approach to your submission according to the following breakdown:

|  	 							| Technical | Conceptual|
| ----------------------------- | :-------: | :-------: |
| Modular Design Approach / Physical Model		| 70 pts	|        	|
| Concept of form 	   			|       	| 20 pts 	|
| Rhino Model 				|  30 pts 	|  		 	|
| Artist Statement 				|       	| 10 pts 	|
| Presentation 					|       	| 10 pts 	|
| Blog post						|       	| 10 pts 	|
| **Total ____ / 150**	 		| **100 pts**| **50 pts**|
