<!-- ![Project 3](/form-fall-16/assets/project2-photo.jpg) -->


# Objective
Model and 3D print a multi-part object using the tools we have learned in Rhino. The design of your form must be conceptually driven and should have **at least 2 unique components that connect with each other**. You will work in [assigned teams](/form-fall-16/p3-groups) to create an object that is modular in nature.  You will be graded equally on the technical and conceptual approach you take for this assignment.

# Requirements
All four of the following components are required for a complete submission. 

1. **Model:** Create a 3D model in Rhino. Show both the individual parts and how they join together to create your modular object.

2. **Physical Object:** Create a physical modular object using the Lulzbot 3D printer. This object should be comprised of a minimum of 2 unique components. These components should connect with each other to create one final object (i.e. the componetns should snap fit, slide in, hook together, etc). You should design these components in Rhino and pay special attention to the connection strategy. ***You are required to 3D print the objects yourself.***

3. **Artist / Design Statement:** A written document (200 words) explaining your concept. Start by coming up with a name and a tagline for your object which will help you to succinctly explain your concept. Use this document as a opportunity to talk about why you have chosen this particular idea along with why and how does the model you have created complements this idea. Save the document as a PDF.

4. **Blog Post:** Create a blog post that includes your artist/design statement and a description of your techincal process in building this project. Your post must also include at least 4 process photos - screenshots of your model and photos of the laser/assembly process. Each person must submit their own blog post, although you may use the same photos and description. Be sure to credit your collaborator (I suggest linking to their blog). 


# Suggestions
+ Be creative! Incorporate different tech and materials and pay strong attention to the form, function and usability of your design. (Refer back to the 10 principles of design at every step of your design process.)
+ The objects can be stand alone or attachments for other objects (or persons)
+ Be mindful of detail in your design
+ Think about the end user AND your final presentation of this object
+ Make something that has some significance to you 
+ Work together!!! You will be evaluated on how well you collaborate :)

# Presentation
Each group is required to prepare a 10 minute presentation of their work. You should prepare a simple slideshow that showcases your process and approach in building this project. Practice your presentation!

You must show your 3d printed objects during your presentation.

*Although you are working in groups for this project, you will be evaluated indidividually. Following presentations, each person will fill out a form explaining their individual contribution in this project and report on the overall dynamic of the group.*

# **Project 3 is due Monday, November 14th**

Be prepared to present your project in front of the class. <br>Submit a link to your blog on Edmodo before class.
