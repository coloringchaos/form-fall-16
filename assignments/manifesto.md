# Design Manifesto

Thinkers and artists have used the manifesto form for centuries to crystallize their thoughts into a succinct, clearly-defined program or call for action. The American [Declaration of Independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence) is a manifesto; so are Martin Luther’s [95 theses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninety-five_Theses). Artists love manifestos, too, whether they be [futurists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifesto_of_Futurism), [surrealists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrealist_Manifesto), or [austere Danish filmmakers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogme_95). At it's core, a Manifesto reacts to the question, *"What do you believe?"*  

Your final assignment for the semester is to write your own manifesto. It can be on any topic related to the course — aesthetics in design, sustainability in making, the iterative design process, the tools of digital fabrication — anything you personally care about in this space. Position yourself within the topic you choose — write passionately, persuasively, and from a personal perspective.

You may structure your manifesto as a thoughtful numbered list, a series of bullet points, a narrative, or any other format that is appropriate for your message. From the serious and heartfelt to the satirical and tongue-in-cheek, you can choose any tone you wish.

Although there is ample creative freedom in this assignment, your manifesto ***must*** be carefully written, edited, and free of gramatical mistakes. Consider alluding to and/or directly referencing readings, class discussions, and projects from the course. 

Your Manifesto must be a minimum of 850 words and a maximum of 1000 words. 

**Your Manifesto is due by 7pm on Thursday, December 15th.** 
<br>Submit your Manifesto as a **pdf** on Edmodo. 

*This Manifesto is worth 80 points.*
