**Course:** ATLS 3100-010/011 <br>
**Instructor:** Arielle Hein <br>
**Email:** arielle.hein@colorado.edu<br>
**Office Hours:** [sign up here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/selfsched?sstoken=UUZYbEdENFRMME1vfGRlZmF1bHR8NmNhMjk2MzA1MTExOTU0ZDI4N2VlNDUzMDRiOGU4Y2I)


# Course Description
This course introduces the fundamentals of 3D modeling, 3D printing, and rapid prototyping from a conceptual and sculptural perspective. Through topical lectures, technical demonstrations and creative projects, the course introduces students to the potentials of thinking and working within 3-dimensional spaces. Rapid prototyping technologies include laser cutting and 3D printing. 

# Class Format
You will be expected to complete readings and watch assigned videos *prior* to our time together, arriving in class prepared to discuss and utilize the techniques presented in the homework. These assigned videos will prepare you with sufficient background knowledge on the material of the lecture; this ensures that we can maximize the benefit of our scheduled class time. 

You will complete four major projects over the coure of the semester, and smaller homework assignment will be due every week. Projects and assignments will require both conceptual and technical skill. 

# Required Resources
+ **[3 button mouse](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-3-Button-Wired-Mouse-Black/dp/B005EJH6RW/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1470681534&sr=8-2&keywords=mouse)** - essential for modeling and navigating in 3 dimensions! Any 3-button mouse will work. Be sure to label your mouse with your name.
+ **[Rhinoceros 3D](https://www.rhino3d.com/)** - commercial grade modeling software available for both PC ($195 student license) & Mac ($95 student license). A full 90-day trial version of Rhino can be obtained [here](https://www.rhino3d.com/download), after which saving and plugins are disabled. Rhino can also be found on all ATLAS computers. **Note that PC and Mac Rhino have different interfaces.*
+ **[CURA Lulzbot Edition](https://www.lulzbot.com/cura)** - free software that prepares your files for printing, by converting your 3D model into GCODE (a filetype used by the 3D printers). It also allows control and operation of the LulzBot 3D printer. This course utilizes a LulzBot TAZ 3D printer with a .5 mm nozel.


# Material Costs
This is a fabrication class, meaning that you will be required to make things IRL (in real life!). In order to do so, you will need materials such as wood, paper or acrylic sheets for the laser cutter and plastic filament for the 3D printer. It is advised to **budget roughly $200 for the semester** to account for these material expenses. You will have full access to the BTU Lab and you are welcome to use the materials there, but you should not rely on these supplies to produce your assignments. It is also encouraged to pair up, and to share the costs for your projects. 

# Laser Cutter & Printer Use
ATLAS currently has 1 Universal 90-Watt CO2 laser cutter and 2 LulzBot TAZ 5 3D printers. These machines are located in the [BTU Lab](http://www.btulab.com/) (ATLS 113). One of the 3D printers and the laser cutter is a shared resource for the BTU Lab and is used by other member of the lab. The second 3D printer is dedicated for this class. 

**You must sign up for machine time!** Because 3D printing can be a long task, sometimes it can take hours to print pieces, we will have a sign up process to use these devices. This way we will ensure that everyone has equal access to the printers.  Please plan your laser cutting and 3D printing projects appropriately, as when the deadlines are approaching it can get hard to find a slot.  If for some reason you are late (by more than 10 mins) for your slot, you will lose your place and at that point anyone may use the printer. **Not having a slot is not a valid excuse for not turning in your assignment.**

Additional resources on campus are the [ITLL Lab](http://itll.colorado.edu/resources/equipment/3d_prototyper/) and the [Idea Forge](http://www.colorado.edu/engineering/giving/college-priorities/idea-forge).


# Attendance
Attendance is mandatory. Students are allowed three absences* after which their final grade will be reduced by 10% for each additional absence. Tardiness (arriving more than 10 minutes late or skipping out early) counts as a .333 absence. Please inform me via email if you are going to miss a class.

**All absences fall under these three absences (e.g. minor illnesses and injuries, oversleeping, vacations, job interviews, ski-days, family obligations and situations, etc.) so it is not wise to use them all at the start of the semester. Exceptions may be made for religious holidays, severe illnesses, and prolonged family emergencies.*


# Participation
This is a participatory course. You are expected to participate in discussions and give feedback to other students both in class and participate with their projects. Be cognizant of how you interact in class discussions. If you find yourself commenting more frequently than most other people in the class, step back and give others a chance to contribute (even if you have something to say). If you tend to hesitate to join discussions, challenge yourself to jump in. 

I take critiques very seriously. Even if your project is not fully completed, it is required that you come to class to give feedback on your classmate's projects. It will affect your grade negatively if you do not show up for critique. Work is expected to be completed prior to the critique, do not attempt to finish your project during critique, have everything you need prepared, tested and ready to present. Student computers will be shut off and full participation is expected when projects are being presented.


# Grading
Students will be assessed on conceptual ideas, technical skills, critical thinking, project presentation, participation and attendance. Projects will be evaluated on conceptual thought, creativity, technical skill, and work finished and presented on the due date.  

If you turn in all your work on time (and if it is satisfactorily completed), and if you attend class and participate, you are ensured a C. A’s and B’s are reserved for students who excel beyond average and competent work. Individual projects that are turned in late will result in the grade being lowered for that project. Feedback through the form of critique is also essential; absence from any of the class critiques will result in a drop of one letter grade for that assignment.

Large projects turned in late will be graded 10% lower for each day that they are late. Small weekly assignments turned in late will be accepted for half credit for one week after their initial due date. After one week, late small assignments will no longer be accepted for credit.

*Grades will be determined according to the following breakdown:*

|---------------|--------:|
| [Project 1](/form-fall-16/project-1) 	| 100 pts |
| [Project 2](/form-fall-16/project-2) 	| 150 pts |
| [Project 3](/form-fall-16/project-3) 	| 150 pts |
| [Final Project](/form-fall-16/final-project) | 200 pts |
| [Design Manifesto](/form-fall-16/manifesto) |	60 pts |
| Weekly Assignments (10 total, 20 pts each) | 200 pts |
| [Attendance & Participation](/form-fall-16/assets/Form2016AttendanceRubric.pdf) | 140 pts |
{:.mbtablestyle}

<br>

A = 90-100%, excellent work <br>
B = 80-89%, above average work <br>
C= 70-79%, average or competent work <br>
D = 60-69%, below average work <br>
F = 0-59%, unsatisfactory work



*You are required to earn a C letter grade or higher in order to continue course work in the TAM program.*


# Assignments & Readings
Unless otherwise specified, all assignments are due at the beginning of class on assigned due dates. All projects, must be turned in online by submitting your work on Edmodo. Unless specifically stated, I do not accept homework via email. If your projects and assignments are not posted on Edmodo, you will not receive credit for them.

***Readings are mandatory!*** Come to class prepared to discuss any assigned reading materials; you will occasionally be given in-class pop-quizzes about any assigned readings. 


# Course Content
The instructor reserves the right to show a broad range of course materials, some of which assume the audience to be adult in age and demeanor. Should a student feel offended by something they have seen or heard, it would appreciated, but not required, to stay to be part of the dialogue to offer your perspective. However if the student feels that they cannot stay, they are welcome to leave the classroom as discretely as possible.


# Freedom of Speech
This class is held in an academic university setting and due to the inherent nature of the internet and broad range of topics that your project work will explore it is inevitable that we will come across issues dealing with politics and religion. My role during such discussions will be a facilitator, a mediator, and as impartial as humanly possible. All students are encouraged to participate in open discussion and academic discourse.

## UNIVERSITY POLICIES
*A full list of CU’s academic policies can be found online at [http://www.colorado.edu/policies](http://www.colorado.edu/policies).*

# Honor Code
All work/ideas/code must be original and created for this class. All code should be written from scratch by you - meaning that although some code is repeatable you should never copy and paste code from other sources and then find and replace your content into it. 

All students of the University of Colorado at Boulder are responsible for knowing and adhering to the academic integrity policy of this institution. Violations of this policy may include: cheating, plagiarism, aid of academic dishonesty, fabrication, lying, bribery, and threatening behavior. All incidents of academic misconduct shall be reported to the Honor Code Council (honor@colorado.edu; 303-735-2273). Students who are found to be in violation of the academic integrity policy will be subject to both academic sanctions from the faculty member and non-academic sanctions (including but not limited to university probation, suspension, or expulsion). Other information on the Honor Code can be found at [http://www.colorado.edu/policies/honor.html](http://www.colorado.edu/policies/honor.html) and at [http://www.colorado.edu/academics/honorcode/](http://www.colorado.edu/academics/honorcode/).

If you fail to meet a guideline by accident, we’ll discuss the situation without taking it to the Honor Council. But if I discover willful intent on your part, I’m obligated to report that to the Honor Council, which has the authority to enforce non-academic corrective action. I retain the authority to enforce academic sanctions, which will range from an F on the project to an F in the course, depending on the severity of the breach of trust.

# Classroom Behavior
Students and faculty each have responsibility for maintaining an appropriate learning environment. Those who fail to adhere to such behavioral standards may be subject to discipline. Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with differences of race, color, culture, religion, creed, politics, veteran’s status, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, and gender expression, age, disability, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student’s legal name. I will gladly honor your request to address you by an alternate name or gender pronoun. Please advise me of this preference early in the semester so that I may make appropriate changes to my records. See policies at [colorado.edu/policies/classbehavior.html](colorado.edu/policies/classbehavior.html) and at [colorado.edu/studentaffairs/judicialaffairs/code.html#student_code](colorado.edu/studentaffairs/judicialaffairs/code.html#student_code).

# Disabilities
If you qualify for accommodations because of a disability, please submit to me a letter from Disability Services in a timely manner (for exam accommodations provide your letter at least one week prior to the exam) so that your needs can be addressed. Disability Services determines accommodations based on documented disabilities. Contact Disability Services at 303-492-8671 or by e-mail at dsinfo@colorado.edu. If you have a temporary medical condition or injury, see Temporary Medical Conditions: Injuries, Surgeries, and Illnesses guidelines under Quick Links at Disability Services website and discuss your needs with your professor.

# Religious Rights
Campus policy regarding religious observances requires that faculty make every effort to deal reasonably and fairly with all students who, because of religious obligations, have conflicts with scheduled exams, assignments or required attendance. See full details at [http://www.colorado.edu/policies/fac_relig.html](http://www.colorado.edu/policies/fac_relig.html).

# Discrimination and Harassment
The University of Colorado Boulder (CU-Boulder) is committed to maintaining a positive learning, working, and living environment. The University of Colorado does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, age, disability, creed, religion, sexual orientation, or veteran status in admission and access to, and treatment and employment in, its educational programs and activities. (Regent Law, Article 10, amended 11/8/2001). CU-Boulder will not tolerate acts of discrimination or harassment based upon Protected Classes or related retaliation against or by any employee or student. For purposes of this CU-Boulder policy, "Protected Classes" refers to race, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, age, disability, creed, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or veteran status. Individuals who believe they have been discriminated against should contact the Office of Discrimination and Harassment (ODH) at 303-492-2127 or the Office of Student Conduct (OSC) at 303-492-5550.
