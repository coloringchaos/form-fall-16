<!-- [Notes on writing an artist statement](https://docs.google.com/a/colorado.edu/document/d/1_vLPyXl-XrZ3rqPYGg20rc6y1lYwqkww4V18PCTn8tU/edit?usp=sharing)
 -->
An artist's **written description** of their work. It is meant to give understanding to the viewer. It is didactic, descriptive, or reflective in nature. 

*Your statement will tell:*

+ **Why you make your art**
+ **What inspires you to make it**
+ **What it signifies or represents**
+ **What is unique or special about how you make it**
+ **What it means to you**

Write in the **first person**, but do not say “I want to…” or “I am trying to…”  Just say it and be precise. Avoid using I and me too much throughout the statement.

Make "I" statements rather than "you" statements. *Talk about what your art does for you, not what it's supposed to do for the viewers.* This doesn't mean you start every sentence with "I," but rather that you respect people's autonomy and allow them to respond to your art however they wish.

**Avoid comparing yourself to other artists.** If other artists influence you, fine, but don't say, "Like Picasso, I do this" or "Like Judd, I do that." Instead, say something like "Picasso's Blue and Rose paintings influence how I use yellow." Better yet, leave other artists out of your statement altogether.

Avoid obscure references

WRITE YOUR STATEMENT IN LANGUAGE THAT ANYONE CAN UNDERSTAND

Do not “tell” the reader what they “must” see in your art.  Say what you (the artist) sees and the viewer may see or interpret something else.

Nobody likes being told what to do - don't instruct people on how to see, feel, behave, respond, or otherwise relate to your art.

Instead of saying "You will experience angst when you see my art," say "This art expresses my angst" or "I express my angst through my art." 

***Have someone else read it!***

Write your statement NOW and come back to it again (and again) later…
