# NURBS VS MESH

<!-- In 3D modeling, it is important to understand the kind of model that you are working with.  --><br>

**Polygon Meshes** are a collection of polygons that defines the 3D shape. A polygon is a closed 2D shape formed by straight edges. The edges meet at points called vertices. There are exactly the same number of vertex points as edges.

**NURBS** stands for Non-uniform rational basis spline.

“The foundation of geometry in Rhino is NURBS, which has its roots in mathematics. Objects are defined by degree, control points, knots, and an valuation rule. Linear means degree 1, quadratic means degree 2, and so on; changing the degree of an object alters its form. Control points correspond to an object’s degree and can be edited to change the shape.”
